# Task:
Create a user interface to navigate the repositories and commits in Netflix’s Github. As a User, I would like to be able to see a list of Netflix’s repositories, and when I click on a repository, I want to be able to see the list of commits. 

# Basic Requirements 
- Create a scrollable list of Netflix’s repositories: https://api.github.com/orgs/Netflix/repos ● Each item in the repository list should show: 
- Repo name 
- Language 
- Description 
- Star Count 
- Fork Count 
- Date Created 
- This list should be sorted by Star Count in 
descending order 
- When clicking on an item in the list, it should show another list of the recent commits 

# Each item in this commits list should show: 
- Commit Title 
- Committer username 
- Commit hash 
- Date Created 

# Extras
- Host the application on AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean, or your own Web Host. Bonus Requirement 
- As a user, I want to be able to type into an input an organization name other than Netflix and see a list of that organization’s repositories and commits instead. 
- Any design additions, UI/UX improvements are always a plus. 

# Instructions 
The requirements are purposely vague because we want to see how you can take a limited spec and create an application that is intuitive and user-friendly. There is no right and wrong way to build this, as long as you can clearly communicate and justify your technical decisions and architecture. We’re looking to use any languages, frameworks, or libraries that you are comfortable with. Submission is due 1 week from receipt of the project. Please upload your code to a public Github repo and include the hosted link, then email the links to the recruiter. Any questions can be clarified with the recruiter.
